## Minje Park (박민제)
### Ph.D. Candidate, Questrom School of Business, Boston University


I am a Ph.D Canidate in Operations and Technology Management at Questrom School of Business, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Anita Tucker](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/anita-tucker/), and work with Professor [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/).

My primary research interests are in the supply chain disruptions and their impact on buyers' behavior and service quality. Specifically, I focus on pharmaceutical supply chains.
