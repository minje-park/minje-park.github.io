## Minje Park
### Questrom School of Business, Boston University

I am a Ph.D student in Operations and Technology Management at Questrom School of Business, Boston University, where I am advised by [Professor Anita Tucker](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/anita-tucker/).

My primary research interests are in the supply chain disruptions and their impact on buyers' behavior and service quality. Specifically, I focus on pharmaceutical supply chains.
